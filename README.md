# README

The messageboard app is a way for me to learn Ruby on Rails and generally get
exposed to the web development process. The gems used will be listed below.
This is a basic CRUD app that will allow users to sign up/log in, create, read,
update, and delete messages on the board. 

# Ruby Version 3.0.3

# Gems used
* Devise - implementing user management and attaching messages to user's accounts

* Guard - For live reloading as files are edited during development

* Guard LiveReload

* Simple Form - Allows for simple creation of forms

* Bulma - Really simple CSS framework

* Better Errors

* Gravatar - For avatar images (not currently properly implemented)
